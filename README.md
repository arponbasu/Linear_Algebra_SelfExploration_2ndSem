# Linear_Algebra_SelfExploration_2ndSem
This contains a theorem and 2 problems that I made as part of my study of Linear Algebra in my second semester. The theorem is a result of the investigation of how (and why, when)
can 2 dense matrices multiply with each other to give the null matrix.

The problems were the product of my rumination about some beautiful mathematical ideas.
