# Linear_Algebra_SelfExploration_2ndSem
This contains a theorem and 2 problems that I made as part of my study of Linear Algebra in my second semester. The theorem is a result of the investigation of how (and why, when)
can 2 dense matrices multiply with each other to give the null matrix.

The problems were the product of my rumination about some beautiful mathematical ideas.

I've uploaded another theorem (potential problem?) in number theory here. Now this repo is not exclusive only to linear algebra ideas. Nevertheless, I'll change the name only
after applying sufficient caution, and not currently.
